# Over-The-Wire-Bandit-Level-12-13-Walk-Through
This is a write-up for level 12-13 of the Over The Wire: Bandit. Bandit is a Linux-based wargame.

This is a long and frustrating level because you might end up running in circles before you figure out what is going on. You will be mostly working with the tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd, mv, file commands so itâ€™s a good idea to figure out what each of them do before you start. When you are done with this level you will realize that the instructions told you everything you needed to know right at the start.
